#  Music Separation Enhancement With Generative Modeling

This is the official implementation of the Make it Sound Good (MSG) model from our 2022 ISMIR paper "Music Separation Enhancement with Generative Modeling" [\[paper\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12387.pdf)[ \[website\]](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io/project/msg.html)

We introduce Make it Sound Good (MSG), a post-processor that enhances the output quality of source separation systems like Demucs, Wavenet, Spleeter, and OpenUnmix
